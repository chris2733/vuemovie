List of top rated movies and tv shows, in different pages
 - with page transition between them

you can scroll any direction, the same movies will keep loading, when they are rendered they will flip onto the page, as they do now
 - the perspective of the whole site changes with mouse direction, as it does now

on click, pops up with movie poster facing you
 - button at bottom fades up from bottom, says read more
 - on read more, gets basic info, tite, rating, director
 - link for trailer?
 - cast link button unfolds a section of the card out to the right, each actor with a profile and name, with link to their page

on close of movie
 - if cast unfolded, fold back first, then place card back


general
 - custom mouse cursor
 - loading screen, something minimalist, simple loader but smooth, maybe gif?
